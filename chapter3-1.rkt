;;; Define a function called at-least-two? that takes one Nat argument and evaluates to an Atom.
;;; at-least-two? evaluates to 't if the Nat is greater than or equal to 2 otherwise it evaluates to 'nil.
;;; Note:
;;; The only Nat eliminator you should need in the body of at-least-two? is which-Nat.
